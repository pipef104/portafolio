              From the first moment I started in this world of software
              development, it has been a very cool journey in which I have been
              able to learn a lot. I have always worked in development for SAP
              as an ABAP developer. In university projects, I have been able to
              implement different technologies, both front-end and back-end. I
              am currently studying Frontend technologies to improve them and be
              able to participate in projects that are related to this.
